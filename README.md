# Random Forest Project
> 4 Geeks Academy - project by @karenL26 :elf:

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that answers the question: *“what sorts of people were more likely to survive?”*.
Using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc), we will train a *Random Forest* model to predict which passengers were more likely to survive.

## Project Structure
- Basic exploratory analysis and the data preparation can be found [here](src/explore_rf.ipynb).

- The Random Forest model was trained and tuned using hyperparameters. 

- The pipeline construction is [here](src/app.py).

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from this [repository](https://github.com/pcsanwald/kaggle-titanic/blob/master/train.csv).
