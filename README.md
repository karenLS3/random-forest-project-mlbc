# Random Forest Project
> 4 Geeks Academy - project by @karenL26 :elf:

The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). To be able to predict which passengers were more likely to survive will be used Random Forest to train the model.

In this project you can find some basic exploratory analysis and the data preparation for modeling [here](src/explore_rf.ipynb).

The model construction use Random Forest and it was applied to it hypertune. 

The pipeline construction is [here](src/app.py).

The dataset was obtained from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/random-forest-project-tutorial/main/titanic_train.csv).
